## IBM.com Library

The library provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable React components to build websites and user interfaces. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

## Install

**Run the following command using**  npm:

   ```sh
   npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
   ```

If you prefer Yarn, use the following command instead:

  ```sh
   yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
   ```

## Getting Started

1. These components require the use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) in your project. See our [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/react/.storybook/webpack.config.js) for an example configuration.

2. Components do not import any of the styles themselves, use the scss 	or css from @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles to bring in styling.

3. For older browsers (e.g. IE11), polyfills listed in [packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js) file is required.

## Usage

View available React Components [here](https://ibmdotcom-react.netlify.com/?path=/story/). You can see usage information in several ways:

1. Clicking the blue Show Info icon in the top right corner of the selected component. You can see the list of available React props.

2. Clicking the STORY tab at the bottom. This tab contains the code that shows how the component is being used.

3. Clicking the KNOBS tab at the bottom and changing values there. Most knobs are shown as something like `Button kind (kind)`  , where `kind` is the name of React prop.

4. Clicking the ACTION LOGGER tab at the bottom and interacting with 	the selected component. You may see something like `onClick` which typically indicates that the event handler (React prop) with the same name is called. You can also expand the twistie to see the details of the event.

5. Clicking the README tab at the bottom. You can see some more document for some components.

## IBM.com Shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the **<DotcomeShell**, which is a React based UI Shell that contains the <Masthead> and the <Footer>, using Carbon's grid. View React Components in [Storybook](https://ibmdotcom-react.netlify.com/?path=/story/dotcom-shell--default).
