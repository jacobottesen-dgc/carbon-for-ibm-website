## IBM.com Library

This library provides front-end developers and engineers a collection of reusable components to build websites and user interfaces quickly and efficiently. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work. 


## Install

**Run the following command using**  npm:

   ```sh
   npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
   ```

If you prefer Yarn, use the following command instead:

  ```sh
   yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-react carbon-components-react carbon-components carbon-icons
   ```

## Getting Started

1. 	These components require the use of Webpack in your project. See 	our webpack.config.js for an example configuration.

2. 	Components do not import any of the styles themselves, use the scss 	or css from @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles to bring in styling.

3. 	For older browsers (e.g. IE11), polyfills listed in packages/	react/.storybook/polyfills.js file is required.


## Usage

You can view available React Components in Storybook and see usage information in several ways below:

1. 	Clicking the “Story” tab at the bottom. This tab contains the code that shows how the component is being used

2. 	Clicking the “Knobs” tab at the bottom and changing values there. Most knobs are shown as something like Button kind (kind), where kind is the name of React prop.

3. 	Clicking the “Readme” tab at the bottom. You can see some more document for some components.

## IBM.com Shell

If you are looking to get started on a page, you can make use of the **<DotcomeShell**, which is a React based UI Shell that contains the <Masthead> and the <Footer>, using Carbon's grid. View React Components in Storybook.
